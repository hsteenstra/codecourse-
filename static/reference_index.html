            <p>
              Hi! I'm Harper, the founder of Code For ME- a local coding camp designed for beginner coders.
              I believe coding is essential to the future. Whether you're building a toaster or designing the
              next iPhone, code is behind it all.
            </p>
            <p>
              I first discovered coding back in third grade, dragging colorful blocks across the screen. I
              instantly fell in love. But once that class ended, I realized how few programming opportunities
              were available for students like me.
            </p>
            <p>
              After years of learning computer science through online and in-person courses, I'm now ready to
              help your child start their coding journey. Thank you for being here — and welcome to Code For ME!

            This textbook is for teachers who are brand new to coding. It gives you a full, ready-to-teach
            week of lessons you can bring straight to your students.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will support you the whole way — with step-by-step guidance, visuals, and structured activities
            so you never feel lost. You do not need to be a coder to teach this.
